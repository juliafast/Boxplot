Description: The Boxplot package has been designed to allow users to create aestheticly pleasing and clean-looking boxplots. This package has specifically been designed for plotting numerical data across a variety of different categories. This package contains 1 function, the boxplot_numeric_category function, which plots a numeric variable across the categories of a categorical variable. This function also cleans the dataset before creating the boxplot by removing any NA values from the dataset. This function works for a variety of different datasets, as can be seen in the examples section of the documentation for the boxplot_numeric_category function, and in the examples section below.
